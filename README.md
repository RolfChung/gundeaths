Gun deaths in the U.S.A 
In this small projects gun deaths in the U.S.A are investigated.
The gun deaths per year are nearly constant from 2012 to 2014.
The gun death by mont has a low in February and peaks in July. 
Some speculations can be done why this is the case.
More males than females are killed by guns. 
Social support actions tailored to males could be justified therefore.
At some point the gun death data set is matched with the census data set.
The census data allows to understand the ethnic connection of gun deaths.
Have some ethnics groups unproportional higher gun deaths than other groups?
The ethnic group 'black' have unproportional 
higher number of gun deaths and homicides.
Social politics could address this with support programs to reduce the numbers 
of people belonging to the "black" suffering from gun death within a time frame.
